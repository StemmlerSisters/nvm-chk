# Automatic Node.js Version Checker Script

This JavaScript script automates the process of checking and managing Node.js versions based on specific conditions:

1. **Check NVM is available or not**
   - The script begins by checking the currently NVM on your system.
   
2. **Comparison Current version with Required Version from `.nvmrc` File:**
   - If the currently installed Node.js version matches the required version, the script logs a success message and terminates.

3. **Using Node Version from `.nvmrc` File:**
   - If the installed Node.js version doesn't match the required version, the script looks for a Node.js version specified in a `.nvmrc` file in your project directory.
   - If an `.nvmrc` file is found and contains a valid Node.js version, the script switches to and uses that version.

4. **Installing Missing Node.js Version:**
   - If there's no `.nvmrc` file or the specified version is not installed, the script prompts the user with a confirmation message.
   - If the user chooses to install the required version, the script proceeds to install it using a `nvm install version`command
   - After installation, the script switche and uses the newly installed version.

5. **Terminating the Script:**
   - If the user chooses not to install the required version, the script gracefully terminates.

This script provides an automated and user-friendly way to ensure that your Node.js environment is set to the required version for your project.
